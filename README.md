# Burger

## Description

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app will allow the user to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat from a list of menu options. Once they click the "Add to Order" button it will add the burger to the "Burgers - Ready to Be Eaten" section. From there the user will then be able to devour or delete that burger. If the user devours the burger it will then be added to the "Devoured Burgers" section. From there the user will have the option to "Have Another" burger of the same or "Delete" the devoured burger. Want to see it in action? Visit the deployed app through the Heroku Link below!! Bon Appetit!!
